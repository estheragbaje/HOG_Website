				"We believe that the Bible is “God’s Word”. The truths revealed in it did not have their origin with men, but with God. The Holy Spirit inspired the human authors of the Bible. We therefore believe that the bible is without error, completely true, relevant and an up-to-date book. We receive the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testament as eternal, authoritative, coherent, complete and all sufficient, and the only infallible rule of faith. Its message is intended primarily for the human race. It is expressed in words and in terms, which human beings can understand. It’s central theme and purpose is the salvation of man.\n\n\n2 Timothy 3:16-17\n2 Peter 1:20-21\nPsalm 12:6\nMatthew 24:35\nPsalm 119:160\n",

				"Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God. He came to the world purposely to save sinners according to the scriptures. He has existed throughout eternity, one of the persons of the Holy Trinity. He is the Son, the only begotten Son of God and the beloved of God. His coming to the world had been foretold before He ever came in the flesh to die for us. He was born by Virgin Mary, conceived of the Holy Spirit, without sin. He lived a perfect life, preached the gospel of the kingdom of God, performed miracles, healed the sick and raised the dead. He voluntarily surrendered his life to his enemies to be crucified. He then resurrected, and ascended to heaven to become our high priest. Jesus Christ will return to establish the kingdom of God on earth, and rule as King of Kings and Lord of Lords with His saints forever.\n\nMatthew 17:15-17\nJohn 1:1-14\nActs 2:32-33\nHebrews 4:14-15\nRevelation 1:13:16\n",

			Name: "Fall of Man",
			Description:
				"Man (Adam) was created in the image of God before whom he walked in innocence, holiness, and purity, but by voluntary disobedience and transgression, he fell from the glory of God to the depths of sin. The consequence of this is that all mankind became sinners by nature having been born after the fallen image of Adam. In his fallen state man is incapable of pleasing God or having any relationship with Him. Every man is totally inclined to evil, guilt and without excuse, deserving the condemnation and judgment of a just and Holy God.\n\nGenesis 1:26-31\nGenesis 2:7\nPsalm 139:14\nCol. 1:16\nPsalm 51:5\nMark 1:15",

			Name: "Salvation",
			Description:
				"Sin is an inward spiritual attitude of rebellion towards God, which is expressed in outward acts of disobedience. Man in his fallen state cannot approach God or save himself and therefore needs a savior. Jesus Christ came to save us from our sins. Himself without sin, He took our sins upon Him, died in our place, and rose again from the dead, that we might be forgiven and receive eternal life. The word salvation in the Greek means “soteria” which is translated “saving” or “deliverance” and preservation from destruction and judgment. To appropriate salvation, we must acknowledge our sins and repent from them; we must believe that Christ died for us, and rose again; we must receive the risen Christ as our personal Savior, and we must publicly confess Him as our Lord.\n\nHebrews 9:29\nRomans 3:10, 23\nActs 3:19\nRomans 10:8-13\nJude 3:24",

			Name: "Sanctification",
			Description:
				"The word sanctification in the Greek language is “hagiasmos” meaning (1) to be apart from sin (2) consecrated unto God, to be conformed to His holiness, purity, and perfection of character. The scripture teaches that “sanctified” is what the believer is [not a process, but a state, which the believer has already entered into once and for all. Acts 20:32; Romans 15:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; Hebrews 10:10-14; Ephesians 5:25-26; 1 Peter 1:2; Acts 26:18], and “perfect” is what he is expected to be. Perfection is a spiritual growth for those who have been sanctified and consecrated. Therefore it is the total yielding of one’s life to the Holy Spirit, living the crucified life; being an overcomer; and being conformed to the image of Christ Himself. Perfection and true holiness are impossible without the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. All attempts at achieving perfection without the Holy Spirit generally results in frustration and failure, inasmuch as “flesh” \ncannot crucify flesh.\n\n1 Peter 2:21-22\n1 Peter 1:15\nJohn 3:8-9\nCorinthians 10:13\nMatthew 5:48",

			Name: "Baptism in the Holy Spirit",
			Description:
				"The baptism in the Holy Ghost is a supernatural endowment with power from heaven to equip the Christian for effective witness and service. \nThe initial evidence of Holy Spirit Baptism is speaking in unknown tongue as the spirit give utterance. The unknown tongue is a prayer language given to the believer, understood by God but unknown to man. It enables the Christian to build up his own spiritual life by direct and continual communion with God, and is the gateway into a life in which both the gifts and fruits of the Holy Ghost should be manifested. In the New Testament church, this experience was considered normal for all believers.\n\nJoel 2:28\nLuke 3:16\nActs 2:38-39\nActs 19:2\nMark 16:17",

			Name: "Divine Healing",
			Description:
				"Sickness is a direct consequence of the fall of man and his continuance in sin. Redemption not only dealt with sin but also its consequences, which includes sickness and diseases. Christ died on the cross; bore not only our sins, but also our sicknesses. Healing for our bodies from God comes to us through appropriation of the finished work of Christ on the cross of Calvary by faith in the word of God and manifestation of the gift of healing. Not only believers receive healing for our bodies, but also we may minister healing and deliverance to others in the name of Jesus. This can be accomplished by laying on of hands, praying for others in absentia and by getting bible believing church elders to anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.\n\nLuke 13:11,16\nJames\n2 Corinthians 1:19-20\n1 John 3:8\nMark 16:17-18",
